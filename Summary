This github repository was initially generated to support the academic publication of DNFA manuscript.

There are several major pipelines used in the manuscript.

1.	DNFA gene expression analysis with TCGA and GTEx databases.
    Including the R script:   CGDSR.R (preferred script for TCGA data analysis)
                              TCGA.R
                              GTEx.R (preferred script for GTEx data analysis)
                              Xena.R (script to analyze both TCGA and GTEx data)

2.	DNFA gene expression analysis on single cell RNA-seq dataset
    Including the R script:   scRNA-Seq.R

3.	RNA-seq analysis for ASO reagent specificity
    Including the R scripts:  Makefile
                              DESeqDataPreparation
                              DESeqandFactoMineRforASOSpecificity.R

4.	Pathway analyses for RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq analyses
    Including the scripts: 	  MACSandHOMERforChIP-Seq.sh
			                        ChIPseeker.R
			                        DESeqandGAGEforPathwayAnalysis.R
